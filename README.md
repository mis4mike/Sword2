# Sword2
STL and SKP files for the light-up sword.

Most of the components for these swords are 3d-printed. I used Ninjaflex brand semiflex filament for its impact resistance.
You can smack these swords around pretty hard and they won't break or deform. Additional components include:

### Electronics (mostly from Adafruit):

- Trinket Pro 5v
- Adafruit Pro Trinket LiIon/LiPoly Backpack Add-On
- Dotstar LED strips (60/meter)
- Lithium Ion Cylindrical Battery - 3.7v 2200mAh
- Colorful Square Tactile Button Switch
- On-Off-On-Off Alternating Power Button / Pushbutton 3-Way Toggle
- White LEDs

### Structural components:

- 3/4" PVC for the hilt
- Steel angle for the hilt (for grip and weight)
- Rebar tie to wrap the angle to the PVC (for grip and weight)
- Fabric tape to wrap the rebar tie
- 1" polycarbonate tube for the blade
- Twe nails to pin the PVC and polycarbonate tube together inside the cross-guard and to pin the pommel on the PVC

The pommel (sword_end and sword_end_gem) houses the battery and the white LEDs which light up when the sword has power.
The cross-guard houses most other components - it has two voids for the two caddies: one for buttons and one for the trinket.
